    <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>
<h2>Attack</h2>
<h2>Eyesight</h2>
<p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed.
     They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.</p>    
<p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
<p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can
     cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
<p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other.
     They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light,
     and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
